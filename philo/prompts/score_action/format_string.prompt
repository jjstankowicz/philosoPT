You should use a "scratchpad" to think about your answer while responding.
Every line of the scratchpad should start with a hashtag (#).
In the scratchpad, go through each philoshopy and write out why the action is moral, immoral, or undecided.
Use the details in your scratchpad to construct your final answer.
Your final response should be a python list of dictionaries.
Each element of the list should correspond to one of the original philoshophies.
The dictionaries should have three keys: "philosophy", "morality", "reason".
The value for the "philosophy" key should be the name of the philoshopy.
The value for the "morality" key should be either "moral", "immoral", or "undecided".
The value of the "reason" key should be a sentence explaining the reasoning for the morality judgement.
