You should use a "scratchpad" to think about your answer while responding.
Every line of the scratchpad should start with a hashtag (#).
Your response should be a python dictionary.
The key should be a one-word summary of the cluster.
The value should be a python list of all the actions in the cluster.
Order the actions in the list according to whether the 
action aligns or does not align with the cluster of the title.
