You should use a "scratchpad" to think about your answer while responding.
Every line of the scratchpad should start with a hashtag (#).
You can use your scratchpad to keep track of the input number and your number of responses.
As a reminder: you will fail if any original actions are missing from the clusters
or if you have added new actions into any of the clusters.
Your final response should be a python dictionary.
The key should be a one-word summary of the cluster.
The value should be a python list of all the actions in the cluster.
Order the actions in the list according to whether the 
action aligns or does not align with the title of the cluster.
