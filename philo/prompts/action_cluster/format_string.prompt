You should use a "scratchpad" to think about your answer while responding.
Every line of the scratchpad should start with a hashtag (#).
Your response should be a python dictionary with the keys "cluster", "reason", and "aligned".

The "cluster" value should be a single python string matching one of the original cluster labels.

The "aligned" key should be a boolean True or False, indicating if the action
is aligned or not aligned with the cluster label.

The "reason" value should be text explaining the reason that the cluster
is appropriate for the key and why it is aligned or not with the cluster label, stored as a python string.
