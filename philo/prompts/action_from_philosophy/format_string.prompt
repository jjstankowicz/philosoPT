You should use a "scratchpad" to think about your answer while responding.
Every line of the scratchpad should start with a hashtag (#).
Your response should be a list of dictionaries
where each dictionary has an "action", a "morality" key, and a "reason" key.
The "action" is a text description of the action.
The "morality" is one of the three strings ["moral", "immoral", "undecided"].
The "reason" key is a single sentence explaining the reasoning.
