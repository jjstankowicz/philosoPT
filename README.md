# Introduction

The goal is to create "unit tests" for different philosophies and analyze the results in various ways.

Though obviously not a perfect approximation, imagine a philosophy is a set of rules that can be applied to a given action to determine if the action is moral.

The morality of an action can then be judged with respect to a given philosophy:

$$
\text{morality} : \text{philosophies} \otimes \text{actions} \to \{ \text{``moral''}, \text{``undecided''}, \text{``immoral''}\}
$$
where:
- $\text{philosophies}$ is a set of philosophies: $\text{philosophies} = \{ \text{Hedonism}, \text{Utilitariansim}, \ldots \}$
- $\text{actions}$ is a set of actions: $\text{actions} = \{ \text{Kill for fun}, \text{Donate to charity}, \ldots \}$
- And $\otimes$ is the outer product.

A large language model (ChatGPT from OpenAI for now) can be used to do all the work:
- Generate a list of philosophies
- For each philosophy, generate two actions that are moral, two that are immoral, and two that are undecided, with a brief explanation
- Perform clustering on the resulting actions
- Judge if each action is moral, immoral, or undecided with respect to each philosophy

The results can be compiled into a "scorecard", as below, or stored in an interactive heatmap (generated by running `$python scripts/run_all.py`).
Notes on this result:
- Each row of the table is a philosophy, and each column is an action.
- The cell colors indicate:
  - White: The action is moral with respect to the philosophy
  - Light blue: The action is undecided with respect to the philosophy
  - Dark blue: The action is immoral with respect to the philosophy
- On the interactive heatmap, hovering over a cell will show the explanation for the morality score.
- The actions are sorted into their clusters, and the clusters are sorted by the number of actions in them.
  - Cluster with the most actions was "Honesty and Deception"
- The philosophies are sorted by the number of moral then undecided then immoral actions. The "most moral" philosophy is at the top, and the "most immoral" philosophy is at the bottom.
  - "Hedonism" is the "most moral philosophy" by this metric, though perhaps it is better to instead call it the "most permissive" philosophy.
