Easy next steps:
- Sort the philosophies by how "permissive" they are (sum over the row in the heatmap).
- Mark the actions that were generated conditioned on being moral/immoral in the philosophy.

Hard next steps:
- For every undecided action, generate modified actions that are moral or immoral conditionally.
- Do not have "undecided" "unit actions" for a philosophy.
- Tell the scoring method it is not allowed to make conditional assumptions.
